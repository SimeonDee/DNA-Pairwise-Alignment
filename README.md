# DNA-Pairwise-Alignment
A VB.Net Project that performs a Pairwise Alignment of DNA Sequences to discover parterns that are similar using Waterman's and Needleman's Algorithm.

DNA sequence alignment is the most fundamental and essential task of bioinformatics. It has to do with the arrangement of DNA sequences in order to identify areas of similarity. Similarity may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. If two sequences in an alignment share a common ancestor, it means they exhibit similar structure or function. Such  information  becomes  of  great  use  in  vital  areas  such  as  the  study  of  diseases, drug discovery, genomics and  generally in the biological sciences. Thus, sequence alignment presents not just an exciting field of study, but a field of great importance to mankind. The two basic alignment algorithms has been used in this project, Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment and Smith-Waterman algorithm for local alignment. The algorithms are implemented using VB.Net programming language. The local and global scores for the sequences are presented.
